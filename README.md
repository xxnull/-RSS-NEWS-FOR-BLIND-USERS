-RSS-NEWS-FOR-BLIND-USERS
=========================

A simple idea to assist blind people in reading news from rss feeds. 

CHECK THE DEMO http://catalejoapps.com/rnews4b/


In this project i use the libraries  


* @package    PHP Text 2 Speech Class
* @category   XML, RSS
* @author     Radovan Janjic <rade@it-radionica.com>

@package    Abs_Xml_Rss
* @category   XML, RSS
* @author     Costin Trifan <costintrifan@yahoo.com>


For the hard job. And my own php + javascript implementation to provide tab browsing 
Please consider help this project worldwide to provide freely access to blind users everywhere a rss file is.

To install 

1. Upload files on your apache server
2. In the file PHP_Text2Speech.class.php go to line 163 and provide your own rss feed
3. Optionaly in comment line 163 and uncomment line 165 to use the google speech API


Any comments are well received

Thanks for your help and support
